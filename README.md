# Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-on-YouTube-Dataset
In this machine learning project, I implemented the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes Classifier to predict the class of YouTube comments. The class of comment being either Ham(0) or Spam(1).

The model is evaluated to visualizes and summarize the performance by creating the confusion matrix and classification report. The model gave pretty good score on all metrics like accuracy, precision and recall. The probability distribution is also visualized using the scatter plot.
